Before we start with the real fun stuff, let's spend a chapter to understand how to use properties in Qlik Sense _Visualization Extensions_.

This chapter only focuses on the basic concept of properties, a detailed overview of all possibilities will be added later on in one of the advanced chapters.

## The Idea Behind Properties
The main idea behind properties is to offer users a way to customize the behavior of visualization extensions in the same way as they would control native objects of Qlik Sense. Therefore an extension developer can use an interface to expose properties which are represented in the right property panel the exactly same way as it is the case with native objects.

There are two main approaches how you can define properties:

1. **Re-use existing** (built-in) **properties**
2. Create **custom properties**
