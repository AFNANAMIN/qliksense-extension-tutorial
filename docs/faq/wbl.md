> The Workbench load file (WBL) is used by the Extension- & Mashup editor and contains a list of files which should be loaded into the editor.
When you save an extension- or mashup project from the editor, a WBL file is automatically created and included in the project.

Note: This file is not necessary for using a visualization extension, just in case you have added some files to Workbench and you want to edit those files in Workbench.
