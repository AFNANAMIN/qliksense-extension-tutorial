Qlik Sense offers two different approaches to develop your visualization extension. One of the approaches is very similar to the extension concept in QlikView, I call it the „Classic Approach“:

You already know the first approach, which uses the `paint` method, which I have described in earlier chapters. Since this approach is very similar to how one has developed extensions in QlikView, this is probably also the favorable approach if you are considering to migrate extensions from QlikView to Qlik Sense.

The other approach is using one of the main underlying technologies of Qlik Sense, AngularJS:

## Basic Example

## More on AngularJS
If you haven't worked with AngularJS so far, I can just recommend to start understanding it, at least the basics. Since AngularJS is {{todo "probably"}} the most famous framework for {{todo "probably XXX"}} it's definitely worth investing the time.

Here are some resources I recommend:

* Official AngularJS site and especially the tutorial (really great)
* If you have a Pluralsight account
* Other videos

## More on how ot use AngularJS in Qlik Sense
For the understanding of the next chapters it's not that relevant if you use the _Classic_ or the _AngularJS_ approach, that's why I'll choose the _classic_ approach.
But later on in this tutorial you'll find some chapter only dedicated how to get the best out of the Extension API in combination with AngularJS.
