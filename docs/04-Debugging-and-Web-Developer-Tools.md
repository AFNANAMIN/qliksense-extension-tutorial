Before we continue improving our Hello World example I think it's now the right moment to talk a little bit about debugging.

In old days JavaScript developers often used [`alert()`](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp) to bring some debug messages to the front. Certainly you can still use this approach, but it becomes very soon more than annoying ... 
So there is a much better way: Using `console.log()` to send data to the **browser console**.

## Outputting text to the console

Nearly all modern browser support



## Chrome Developer Tools
