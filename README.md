# Qlik Sense Extension Tutorial

> A comprehensive tutorial how to create Qlik Sense Visualization Extensions

## About this Tutorial

In this tutorial you'll learn how to use Qlik Sense' Extension concept to bring new visualizations into the Qlik Sense Client.

### Work in Progress, Always

This project is work in progress and will and should always remain in this status, that's part of the concept and the idea of creating a ***living tutorial***. As soon as there are now capabilities exposed in Qlik Sense' Extension API, I will update the appropriate sections here.

If you want to follow the progress of this project there are some options:

* [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join) and "Watch" this project
* [Follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/waltherstefan), as soon as I have finished a new chapter, I'll announce it there
