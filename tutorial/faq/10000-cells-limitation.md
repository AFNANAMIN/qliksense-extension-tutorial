# 10,000 cells limitation



There is a persistent rumor that you can only load 10,000 data-cells when working with a HyperCube using the Client APIs.

**This rumor is not true!!!**

Instead it's true that you can only fetch 10,000 records per data page from the Engine, but you can certainly request to get more data pages.

Have a look into the official documentation to learn more about the paging concept of Qlik Sense:
