## Why using AngularJS?
You might ask yourself now why you should learn how to use a new framework "just" to implement AngularJS based visualization extensions for Qlik Sense.
It is certainly up to you, I wouldn't say that the one or the other approach is better.

Here are some reasons why I have fully adopted this approach:

* It makes data-binding much easier
* Especially when writing more complex and larger Qlik Sense visualization extensions it helps you to keep your code organized and it reduces the dependencies, so maintaining a larger code-base is much, much easier.
* As soon as you start working with AngularJS you'll understand much better what's going on in the Qlik Sense client.
* It's just fun learning the most popular framework to build web apps out there

## Learn by examples
Much better than any tutorial is to review existing solutions and their code, here's a collection of visualization extensions using the AngularJS approach:
