## What is a .wbl file##
> The Workbench load file (WBL) is used by the Mashup editor and lists the name of all files included in the mashup project. When you save a mashup project from the Mashup editor, a WBL file is automatically included in the project.

Note: This file is not necessary for using a visualization extension, just in case you have added some files to Workbench and you want to edit those files in Workbench.

## Changes made in a visualization extension are not reflected
* When developing visualization extensions and testing them in Qlik Sense Desktop it might happen that you don't immediately see the changes.
The reason for this behavior is that Qlik Sense Desktop is using the Chromium browser and because of current settings the Chromium browser is aggressively caching websites.

The best solution for this behavior:

- Open Qlik Sense Desktop (and keep it open)
- At the same time use any installed browser (e.g. Chrome) and load http://localhost:4848/hub

If you want to **completely disable browser caching** e.g. in Chrome you can configure Chrome as such:

- Open Chrome's DevTools (F12)
- Go to "Settings"
- Check "Disable cache (while DevTools is open)
