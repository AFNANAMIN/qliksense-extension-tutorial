# Introduction to Using Properties



Before we start with the real fun stuff, let's spend a chapter or some minutes to understand the basic principles behind defining and using properties in Qlik Sense _Visualization Extensions_.

This chapter only focuses on the basic concept of properties, a detailed overview of all possibilities will be added later on in one of the advanced chapters.

## The Idea Behind Properties
The main idea behind properties is to offer users a way to customize the behavior of _visualization extensions_ in the same way as they would control Qlik Sense' native objects. Therefore an extension developer can use a programmatic interface to define properties which are then displayed in the right property panel the exactly same way as it is the case with native objects.

## The property panel

If you have a look at the property panel accordion you'll recognize that properties are structured in a hierarchy as follows:

* **Accordion**
	* Accordion **sections**
		* Section **headers**
			* Property **items**

## Property panel definition in your JavaScript file

As already mentioned in the previous chapter, properties can be added by defining them in the `definition` property of the extension's JavaScript file:




## Built-in vs. custom properties
There are two main approaches how you can define properties:

1. **Re-use existing** (built-in) **properties**
2. Create **custom properties**

### Re-use existing properties

If you have spent some time with Qlik Sense, you already know the concept of typical properties used for the most common native objects:

* Every native object has a section called "Appearance" and a section header called "General"
* Most of the native objects allow "Dimensions" and "Measures" to be defined

If you create a visualization extension without specifying any specific properties to be shown in the property panel you'll get the following:

**Code:**

```javascript
define( [
		'jquery'
	],
	function ( $ ) {
		'use strict';

		return {

			paint: function ( $element /*, layout*/ ) {

				$element.empty();
				var $msg = $( document.createElement( 'div' ) );
				$msg.html( 'Just demonstrating default behavior of the property panel"' );
				$element.append( $msg );

			}
		};

	} );
```

**Result:**

So getting the "Appearance" section is the default behavior.

You'll get the same result by telling Qlik Sense to re-use the section "settings" (which is the internal name for the "Appearance" section.

```javascript
define( [
		'jquery'
	],
	function ( $ ) {
		'use strict';

		return {

			definition: {
				type: "items",
				component: "accordion",
				items: {
					appearance: {
						uses: "settings"
					}
				}
			},

			paint: function ( $element /*, layout*/ ) {

				$element.empty();
				var $msg = $( document.createElement( 'div' ) );
				$msg.html( 'Just demonstrating default behavior of the property panel"' );
				$element.append( $msg );

			}
		};

	} );

```

Based on this example we can now extend `definition` to re-use other built-in sections.

**Code:**

```javascript
// --
// Reuse the following sections
//	- dimensions
//	- measures
//	- sorting
//	- settings ("Appearance" section)
// --
definition: {
	type: "items",
	component: "accordion",
	items: {
		dimensions: {
			uses: "dimensions"
		},
		measures: {
			uses: "measures"
		},
		sorting: {
			uses: "sorting"
		},
		appearance: {
			uses: "settings"
		}
	}
}
```

**Result:**

#### Referencing properties

As we have now defined some properties to use in our extension, let's have a look how to reference the properties in our code.

We haven't covered this so far: A second parameter called `layout` will be passed to the `paint` method, which includes the current scope the extension object, also "holding" the properties we have defined.

```javascript
paint: function ( $element, layout ) {

	console.info('paint >> layout >> ', layout);

}
```

If you have a look at the console output of e.g. Chrome's Dev Tools, you can easily find what you are looking for:

![](images/06/06_Console_Properties.png)  

So let's output some values in our `paint` method:

```javascript
paint: function ( $element, layout ) {

	// Output values from the property panel
	$element.empty();

	// Our output container
	var $msg = $( document.createElement( 'div' ) );

	// Variable holding the output
	var html = '<b>Property values:</b><br/>';
	html += 'Title: ' + layout.title + '<br/>';
	html += 'SubTitle: ' + layout.subtitle + '<br/>';

	// Assigning the variable to our output container
	$msg.html( html );

	// Adding the output container to the current element
	$element.append( $msg );

}
```

Great, you now can use built-in properties in your _visualization extension_ in the next chapter we'll explore how to customize the property panel to get our very custom properties into there to allow users to configure the behavior of your _visualization extension_.
